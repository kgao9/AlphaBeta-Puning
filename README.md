# AlphaBeta-Puning
This program uses alpha beta pruning for a specific version of tic tac toe.
It's tic tac toe on a 3 by 4 board where each square is one of these:
{X, O, #}.

The only thing I don't really like about this piece of code is that
there are hard coded values in the win/lose/draw methods.

I probably should have provided a constants class and made those constants.
:/

Also the print method isn't as visual as I would like, but it is
"visualizable."

Also the documentation should be better. Other than that, the logic is sound.
